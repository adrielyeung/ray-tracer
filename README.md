# ray-tracer
(Project for 2nd Year Computing course in spring 2017)

Optical ray tracing is important in designing optical equipment before production. A simple optical system, lenses, is simulated here, using geometric optics.

Program written in Python 3. This folder contains:
- ```genpolar.py```
  This is the code for generating uniformly distributed radius and angle pairs.
- ```gettingstarted.py```
  This is the code for generating results for the single spherical surface case.
- ```plan1.py```
  This is the code for generating results for planoconvex lens orientation 1, i.e.
  with plane surface facing light source.
- ```plan2.py```
  This is the code for generating results for planoconvex lens orientation 2, i.e.
  with convex surface facing light source.
- ```raytracerfinal.py```
  This is the code that contains all elements involved in the ray tracer, including classes
  ```ray, SphericalRefraction, OutputPlane``` and ```raybun```.
- ```task4.py```
  This is the code for the tests in Task 4.
- ```task5.py```
  This is the code for the tests in Task 5.
- ```task7.py```
  This is the code for the tests in Task 7.
- ```task8.py```
  This is the code for the tests in Task 8.
 
Details of each task can be found in the PDF report.
